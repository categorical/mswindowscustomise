--- SURPRISE ATTACK from microsoft's disk encryption ---

microsoft turns on its encryption on behalf of user (seemingly) when
    1 tpm enabled through bios
    2 booted into ms windows
    3 ?
this happened (after rewiring motherboard) but has not been reproduced through bios settings

apart from manually enabling tpm/secure boot through bios,
resetting the motherboard causes tpm to be enabled as well

suspecting bios entries include: fast boot, secure boot and tpm


linux will not boot if any partitons to be mounted become locked by windows
when logging into ms windows again,
observer microsoft is busy encrypting all drives it finds
manage-bde -status c:

this command and the entire microsoft's "feature" might block,
because windows is fully engaged encrypting your drives

try run `manage-bde -off c:` to decrypt
but I doubt this would have no effect on the filesystem even if the encryption is undone



registry entry might prevent this uncalled encryption,
but as the trigger is elusive and the madness is not reproducible
nothing can be verified to have an effect

reg query 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\BitLocker'
reg add 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\BitLocker' /v preventdeviceencryption /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
reg delete 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\BitLocker' /v preventdeviceencryption /f
